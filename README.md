# VHCSite Models

This is the GitHub for the models used in my website [vhcblade.com](vhcblade.com). I made this open source so that anyone can just take it and use it for their own projects.

This project also serves as a demonstration for the various event-based packages I've developed for Flutter, as well as Dart in general.

# Packages Used

- [event_db](github.com/VHCBlade/event_db) - A companion package for handling serializable models and databases with event_bloc.
